### ShellChat - Computer Networks Project
By: Edel Altares, Cody Fulford, Jeremy Lau, Sumeet Patel, Lukas Van Dyke


##### What is this?
ShellChat is an instant messeging application we built from scratch in java. The server portion of the code ran on an Ubuntu virtual server, and the client could run on any machine with jre. The point of the project was to implement network features such as file transfer and handle multiple connections, so we didn't focus on ease of use.

##### Features:
(ripped from the marking rubric) 
* User accounts (profiles) on the messenger server
* User login/logout (no encryption needed)
* Create and maintain a friend list
* Support chat and file transfer (both binary and text files)
* List friendsâ€™ online/offline status in real time
* Maintain chat history/log
* Handle user disconnection and reconnection (resume chat by retrieving and loading the chat history)
* Maintain a file repository for each user account to store all sent and received files
* List all online friends
* Group chat (invite friends to join)
* Allow ongoing chat to continue in another device
* Public chat channels (chat history is visible to all users)
